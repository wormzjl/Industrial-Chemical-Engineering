# 2026-11-12 fluid conversion

Status: Planned. The owner's plan is reviewed; no implementation has started. Branch `claude/fluid-conversion-plan-review-786fbc`, cut from `main` at `ccde84295` (0.27.1).

Purpose: a converter between standard Forge (NeoForge) fluids and IChemE fluids.

## The owner's plan (2026-11-12)

Add a fluid conversion system between standard forge fluid and IChemE fluid:

- A converter equipment, which has a tank for forge fluid and another tank for IChemE fluid, and a controller in between. It is scalable with increasing tank size and max conversion rate.
- It can convert in both directions, set in the GUI; it can also operate in a "balance mode" which tries to balance the amount of fluid in both tanks. Max conversion rate can be set in the GUI as well.
- Has an internal level meter connected to DCS and can set a level alarm. Operating parameters can be set by DCS as well.
- Forge fluid converts to IChemE fluid based on a specified rule, with defined composition, pressure, temperature. For example, crude oil converts to medium crude with ambient P, T. Forge fluid is considered volumetric and 1 mB = 1 L. Look for other fluids on the market that can join the pre-defined rule.
- IChemE fluid converting to forge fluid needs a well specified composition range and P, T range. For example, a fluid needs composition A > 40 %, B > 40 %, and C < 5 %, P range 1.0-1.5 bar, and T range 10-40 C.
- Conversion rule defined via data pack, customizable via KubeJS.

## History

- 2026-11-12: batch opened. The plan reviewed for what it lacks (FLUID_CONVERSION_PLAN_REVIEW.md): 25 gaps in six groups, seven of them owner decisions. Documents only, no test run.

## Documents

- [FLUID_CONVERSION_PLAN_REVIEW.md](FLUID_CONVERSION_PLAN_REVIEW.md): the gaps in the plan (physics and conservation, engine schedule, rule semantics, balance mode, equipment and integration, saves and verification) and the decisions for the owner.

## Code areas

None yet.

## Open items

- The owner's decisions P2, P4, P5, E2, B2, Q1 and Q4 of the review.
- The Forge fluid survey (Q5).
- `FLUID_CONVERSION_PLAN.md`, after the decisions.
